 \r\nIs gnome's GTK used?\r\nIs kde's QT used?\r\nThe answer is no.  \r\nThe X11 library, probably already required by most X11 client software, is used.  \r\nAnd a few other xorg provided libraries are used.\r\n\r\nThe mesa library, nvidia provided pre-compiled libraries and\r\nthe fancy screen saver hacks are not provided and are not required.  \r\nIf desired then at youtube in the video description\r\nthe software and home pages are cited.  \r\nThe default configuration file and\r\nthe during video recording configuration file are similar.  \r\nTherefore, by anyone the same tricks can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIf proper credit was accidentally omitted\r\nthen with a mere notification the mistake will be fixed.  \r\nTo fellow artists who freely share their artwork; paramount admiration and respect is accorded.  \r\nTo forkers and to \"fair use\" abusers; significant disdain is accorded.\r\n\r\nIf the code is not yet uploaded\r\nthen the license and some insignificant details are being honed.  \r\nBefore 2017 the source code will be uploaded.  \r\nMore hugs; less bugs.",
