that is the question.  \r\nFor source tarball download; less than a megabyte is required.  \r\nBy watching the 90 second demonstration videos  \r\nmany hundred megabytes are consumed.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yOQqAqWKzMI\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yOQqAqWKzMI/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LnQnVZUjWmE\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/LnQnVZUjWmE/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Modify\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6tsaPEzHPPU\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/6tsaPEzHPPU/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Sack\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jUw2d7blIE4\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jUw2d7blIE4/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Desk\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w21ule8z3oc\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w21ule8z3oc/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Gamma\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MZBMF5s29v8\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/MZBMF5s29v8/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Launch\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jZ4BVSWwsyQ\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jZ4BVSWwsyQ/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"Various Aspects\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\nXlaunch requirements are minimal.  \r\nNaturally, a POSIX is required.  \r\nA Linux API translation wrapper probably does not suffice.\r\n\r\nSoftware projects xorg and linux-pam are required.  \r\nIf linux-pam is not installed  \r\nthen program xl-lock only can not be compiled.  \r\nIn the README file the required software,\r\ntheir universal resource locators,\r\nand command lines are provided.\r\n\r\nFor configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.\r\n\r\nFor allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.  \r\nSoftware developer information follows.\r\n\r\nAt release; for a few years already; XLaunch has been in use.  \r\nThe code quality is mature and revised.\r\n\r\nA larger than mozilla program is not desired and was not created.  \r\nTo compile and link; less than a minute is required.\r\n\r\nBefore contemplating forking;\r\nthe library interface should be inspected.  \r\nBy linking with the XLaunch library;\r\nby new software projects;\r\nXLaunch provided shared library functions\r\nand variable structures can be used.  \r\nIn that fashion XLaunch is extensible.  \r\n\r\nTo the XLaunch software suite  \r\nfor an additional program to be added\r\na fork is not required.  \r\nIf the project is published separately;  \r\nif code from XLaunch is not copied  \r\nthen any license can be applied.  \r\nBy a fork from the Pellucid Free License departure is not possible.  \r\nFor license liberty  \r\nin a separate software project;  \r\nentirely original code is required.\r\n\r\nAn extension example follows.  \r\nBy the provided window modification code  \r\nan optimal experience might not become.  \r\nLarger than root windows can be created.  \r\nFrom the root window visible area any window portion can depart.  \r\n\r\nDuring window modification an anchor point change might be required.  \r\nHowever, with an immobile cursor if coded  \r\nthen an anchor point change would not be required.  \r\nA different experience would become.\r\n\r\nSeveral window modification methods were tried.  \r\nSome were abandoned.  \r\nUltimately, the software author's preferences are provided.  \r\nHowever, more than one good window size/slide method exists.  \r\nDue to the XLaunch design in lieu of any method\r\nby the same key combination or by a different key combination\r\nan entirely different program can be launched.\r\n\r\nNeither the GTK+ nor the QT libraries are used.  \r\nThe X11 library is used.  \r\nA few other xorg provided libraries are used.  \r\nConsequently, memory usage is light.\r\n\r\nThe mesa library and graphic hacks are not provided.  \r\nAt youtube in the video description;  \r\nthe software project names and home pages are cited.  \r\nThe default configuration file and\r\nthe during video recording configuration file are similar.  \r\nTherefore, by anyone the same tricks can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIf credit was omitted then with notification the mistake will be fixed.  \r\nTo fellow free artists; paramount admiration  is accorded.  \r\nTo \"fair use\" abusers; and to forkers; disdain is accorded.\r\n\r\nIf the code is not yet uploaded\r\nthen the license and some insignificant details are being honed.  \r\nBefore 2017 the source code will be uploaded.  \r\nMore hugs; less bugs.",
