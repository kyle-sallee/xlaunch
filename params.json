that is the question.\r\nBy downloading a source tarball; less a fraction of a megabyte bandwidth is consumed.\r\nInstead by watching the 90 second each youtube hosted demonstration videos\r\nhundreds of megabytes of bandwidth can be consumed.\r\nWhy not commit 10 minutes and a hundreds of megabytes, right?\r\nThe URLs to youtube hosted demonstration videos follow.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yOQqAqWKzMI\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yOQqAqWKzMI/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Overview\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LnQnVZUjWmE\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/LnQnVZUjWmE/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Modify\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6tsaPEzHPPU\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/6tsaPEzHPPU/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Sack\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jUw2d7blIE4\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jUw2d7blIE4/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Desk\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w21ule8z3oc\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w21ule8z3oc/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Gamma\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MZBMF5s29v8\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/MZBMF5s29v80.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Launch\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jZ4BVSWwsyQ\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jZ4BVSWwsyQ.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Various Aspects\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nTo use XLaunch not much is required.\r\nNaturally, a POSIX, portable operating system for running UNIX like software, is required.\r\nA Linux API translator will probably suffice.\r\n\r\nSoftware projects xorg and linux-pam are required.\r\nIf linux-pam is not installed\r\nthen program xl-lock only can not be compiled and linked.\r\nIn the README file the required software,\r\nuniversal resource locators, and command lines are provided.\r\n\r\nFor configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.\r\nBy the nano software project an adequate and easy to use text editor is provided.\r\nHowever, the sed stream editor or vi also could be used.\r\n\r\nFor allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.\r\nSoftware developer information follows.\r\n\r\nAt XLaunch release; for a few years XLaunch has been in use.\r\nThe author's desires; Xlaunch accomplishes.\r\nEveryone else's desires; probably do not become.\r\nA larger than mozilla firefox hot key program is not desirable.\r\n\r\nBefore contemplating an XLaunch fork;\r\nthe library interface should be learned.\r\nBy linking with the XLaunch library;\r\nby new software projects;\r\nXLaunch provided frequently convenient functions\r\nand variable structures can be used.\r\nIn that fashion XLaunch is extensible.\r\n\r\nXLaunch compatible programs should: be tiny; accomplish a specific task; and exit.\r\nConstant consumption of half a gigabyte of RAM or more is obscenely wasteful.\r\nFor most window manager and desktop environment software;\r\nconstant wasteful RAM consumption is the succinct description\r\nIn the niche of fast lean code; XLaunch exists.\r\n\r\nBy a few curious software developers\r\nthe used graphics toolkit library would be desired.\r\nIs gnome's GTK used?\r\nIs kde's QT used?\r\nThe answer is no.\r\nThe X11 library, probably already required by most X11 client software, is used.\r\nAnd a few other xorg provided libraries are used.\r\n\r\nThe mesa library, nvidia provided pre-compiled libraries and\r\nfancy screen saver hacks are not provided and are not required.\r\nIf desired then by each video when viewed at youtube\r\nby the video description the software used and home pages are cited.\r\n\r\nIf proper credit was accidentally omitted\r\nthen with a mere notification the mistake will be fixed.\r\nTo fellow artists who freely share their artwork; paramount admiration and respect is accorded.\r\nTo no talent, no vision, code forkers and to \"fair use\" abusers; significant disdain is accorded.\r\n\r\nIf the code is not yet uploaded\r\nthen the license and some insignificant details are being honed.\r\nBefore 2017 the source code will be uploaded.\r\nMore hugs; less bugs.",
