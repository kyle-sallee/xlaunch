that is the question.\r\nBy downloading a source tarball; less a fraction of a megabyte bandwidth is consumed.\r\nInstead by watching the 90 second each youtube hosted demonstration videos\r\nhundreds of megabytes of bandwidth can be consumed.\r\nWhy not commit 10 minutes and a hundreds of megabytes, right?\r\nThe URLs to youtube hosted demonstration videos follow.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yOQqAqWKzMI\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/yOQqAqWKzMI/0.jpg\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LnQnVZUjWmE\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/LnQnVZUjWmE/0.jpg\" alt=\"Modify\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6tsaPEzHPPU\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/6tsaPEzHPPU/0.jpg\" alt=\"Sack\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jUw2d7blIE4\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jUw2d7blIE4/0.jpg\" alt=\"Desk\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=w21ule8z3oc\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/w21ule8z3oc/0.jpg\" alt=\"Gamma\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=MZBMF5s29v8\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/MZBMF5s29v8.jpg\" alt=\"Launch\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jZ4BVSWwsyQ\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n<img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/jZ4BVSWwsyQ.jpg\" alt=\"Various Aspects\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\"/></a>\r\n\r\nXlaunch requirements are minimal.\r\nNaturally, a POSIX, portable operating system for running UNIX like software, is required.\r\nA Linux API translator probably does not suffice.\r\n\r\nSoftware projects xorg and linux-pam are required.\r\nIf linux-pam is not installed\r\nthen program xl-lock only can not be compiled.\r\nIn the README file the required software,\r\nuniversal resource locators, and command lines are provided.\r\n\r\nFor configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.\r\n\r\nFor allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.\r\nSoftware developer information follows.\r\n\r\nAt XLaunch release; for a few years XLaunch has been in use.\r\nA larger than mozilla firefox hot key program is not desirable.\r\nTherefore, barely more than the software author desired;\r\nxlaunch can accomplish.\r\n\r\nBefore contemplating an XLaunch fork;\r\nthe library interface should be inspected.\r\nBy linking with the XLaunch library;\r\nby new software projects;\r\nXLaunch provided frequently convenient functions\r\nand variable structures can be used.\r\nIn that fashion XLaunch is extensible.\r\nTo the XLaunch software suite\r\nfor an additional program to be added\r\na software fork is not required.\r\nXLaunch programs should: be tiny; accomplish a specific task; and exit.\r\n\r\nBy a few curious software developers\r\nthe used graphics toolkit library would be desired.\r\nIs gnome's GTK used?\r\nIs kde's QT used?\r\nThe answer is no.\r\nThe X11 library, probably already required by most X11 client software, is used.\r\nAnd a few other xorg provided libraries are used.\r\n\r\nThe mesa library, nvidia provided pre-compiled libraries and\r\nthe fancy screen saver hacks are not provided and are not required.\r\nIf desired then by each video when viewed at youtube\r\nby the video description the software used and home pages are cited.\r\nThe default configuration file and\r\nthe during video recording configuration file probably do not significantly differ.\r\nTherefore, by anyone the same tricks can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIf proper credit was accidentally omitted\r\nthen with a mere notification the mistake will be fixed.\r\nTo fellow artists who freely share their artwork; paramount admiration and respect is accorded.\r\nTo forkers and to \"fair use\" abusers; significant disdain is accorded.\r\n\r\nIf the code is not yet uploaded\r\nthen the license and some insignificant details are being honed.\r\nBefore 2017 the source code will be uploaded.\r\nMore hugs; less bugs.",
