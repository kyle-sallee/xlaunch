The Liberty License

Cost   is the compliance required:
for legal attainment     of goods;
for legal attainment     of services.
Free   is the antithesis of cost.
Free   is without cost.

Liberty is the ability to do as one desires.
Freedom of speech is the ability to express opinions without censorship.

By   a     "freedom of speech" license
code and   documentation modification liberty,
with some  exclusions,   is mandatory.

By    a free license;
without cost acquisition liberty is mandatory.

By   The Liberty License

To  the first  and original author only
license change liberty   is granted.
By  the first  and original author only
a   different  license  can be     applied.
In  a license  change event the    change is retroactive.

and   are          prohibited.

On    media  such as CD, fixed disk, SSD, etc...
where barter or purchase is required for acquisition;
hosting  is  prohibited.

Cost attachment gimmicks are prohibited!
Common cost attachment gimicks follow:

On  the following hosting  is           allowed:

without purchase, to all   persons the  acquisition is granted;
by    a server    where    anonymous    download    is allowed.

For derivative    artwork
a   separate      and      distinct  name  is  required.
Appended or prepended      bytes     does  not suffice.
Among       precursor and  derivative names
potential   ambiguity must not exist.

Examples    follow.
For a       progenitor  name      gtk  is used.
For a       progeny     name      gtk+ is used.
To  an      uninformed  person    the  names can be confused.
Therefore   to mitigate ambiguity the  progeny name must differ.

For a       progenitor  name      gtk  is used.
For a       progeny     name      htk  is used.
For an      uninformed  person;   ambiguity should not become.
The         progeny     name      suffices.

For         software artwork derivatives;
with    the original project
while   as  few   as eight   adjacent bytes remain
the     license  can not  be abandoned.
Towards the byte similarity  count;
third   party    library     function invocations, and
third   party    library     variable declaration  do not count.

If   the  license   conditions  are not met
then all  liberties are denied.
