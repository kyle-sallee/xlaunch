        <p>A desktop environment is not provided.<br>
A window manager is not provided.<br>
The code megabytes required for window manager fluff is not provided.</p>

<p>By XLaunch an X11 hot key program launcher is provided.<br>
A few kilobytes required by window geometry modification code is provided.<br>
A couple tricks not found in or rare among the window manager niche are provided.</p>

<p>Who does not like "try before buy?"<br>
How about "try and not buy?"<br>
Does that seem better?</p>

<p>XLaunch is free software.<br>
Within the freedom XLaunch must remain.<br>
To the paydom XLaunch must never be exported.</p>

<p>To use or not to use; that is the question.<br>
By downloading a source tarball; less a fraction of a megabyte bandwidth is consumed.<br>
Instead by watching the 90 second each youtube hosted demonstration videos
hundreds of megabytes of bandwidth can be consumed.
Why not commit 10 minutes and a hundreds of megabytes, right?<br>
The URLs to youtube hosted demonstration videos follow.</p>

<p>Xlaunch requirements are minimal.
Naturally, a POSIX, portable operating system for running UNIX like software, is required.<br>
A Linux API translator probably does not suffice.</p>

<p>Software projects xorg and linux-pam are required.<br>
If linux-pam is not installed<br>
then program xl-lock only can not be compiled.<br>
In the README file the required software,
universal resource locators, and command lines are provided.</p>

<p>For configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.</p>

<p>For allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.<br>
Software developer information follows.</p>

<p>At release; for a few years already XLaunch has been in use.<br>
A larger than mozilla firefox hot key program is not desired and was not created.<br>
A window manager similar experience will not become.<br>
Most  of the window manager solicited irritations, and
a few of the window manager provided conveniences are omitted.</p>

<p>Before contemplating an XLaunch fork;
the library interface should be inspected.<br>
By linking with the XLaunch library;
by new software projects;
XLaunch provided shared library functions
and variable structures can be used.<br>
In that fashion XLaunch is extensible.  </p>

<p>To the XLaunch software suite
for an additional program to be added
an entire software fork is not required.<br>
If the project is published separately and
code from XLaunch is not copied
then any license can be applied.</p>

<p>An example follows.<br>
By the provided window modification code
an optimal experience might not become.
Larger than root windows can be created.<br>
From the root window visible area any window portion can depart.  </p>

<p>During modification a change in anchor point might be required.<br>
If an immobile cursor was used<br>
then an anchor point would not be required.
A different experience would become.</p>

<p>Several window modification methods were tried.<br>
Some were abandoned.<br>
Ultimately, the software author's preferences are provided.<br>
However, more than one good window size/slide method exists.<br>
Due to the XLaunch design in lieu of any method
by the same key combination or by a different key combination
an entirely different program can be launched.</p>

<p>Perhaps curiosity concerning  the used graphics toolkit library exists?<br>
Is gnome's GTK used?
Is kde's QT used?
The answer is no.<br>
The X11 library, probably already required by most X11 client software, is used.<br>
And a few other xorg provided libraries are used.</p>

<p>The mesa library, nvidia provided pre-compiled libraries and
the fancy screen saver hacks are not provided and are not required.<br>
If desired then at youtube in the video description
the software and home pages are cited.<br>
The default configuration file and
the during video recording configuration file are similar.<br>
Therefore, by anyone the same tricks can be accomplished.</p>

<p>If proper credit was accidentally omitted
then with a mere notification the mistake will be fixed.<br>
To fellow artists who freely share their artwork; paramount admiration and respect is accorded.<br>
To forkers and to "fair use" abusers; significant disdain is accorded.</p>

<p>If the code is not yet uploaded
then the license and some insignificant details are being honed.<br>
Before 2017 the source code will be uploaded.<br>
More hugs; less bugs.</p>
