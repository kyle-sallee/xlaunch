        <p>A desktop environment is not provided.
A window manager is not provided.
The code megabytes required for window manager fluff is not provided.</p>

<p>By XLaunch an X11 hot key program launcher is provided.
A few kilobytes required by window geometry modification code is provided.
A couple tricks not found in or rare among the window manager niche are provided.</p>

<p>Who does not like "try before buy?"
How about "try and not buy?"
Does that seem better?</p>

<p>XLaunch is free software.
Within the freedom XLaunch must remain.
To the paydom XLaunch must never be exported.</p>

<p>To use or not to use; that is the question.
By downloading a source tarball; less a fraction of a megabyte bandwidth is consumed.
Instead by watching the 90 second each youtube hosted demonstration videos
hundreds of megabytes of bandwidth can be consumed.
Why not commit 10 minutes and a hundreds of megabytes, right?
The URLs to youtube hosted demonstration videos follow.</p>

<p>To use XLaunch not much is required.
Naturally, a POSIX, portable operating system for running UNIX like software, is required.
A Linux API translator will probably suffice.</p>

<p>Software projects xorg and linux-pam are required.
If linux-pam is not installed
then program xl-lock only can not be compiled and linked.
In the README file the required software,
universal resource locators, and command lines are provided.</p>

<p>For configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.
By the nano software project an adequate and easy to use text editor is provided.
However, the sed stream editor or vi also could be used.</p>

<p>For allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.
Software developer information follows.</p>

<p>At XLaunch release; for a few years XLaunch has been in use.
The author's desires; Xlaunch accomplishes.
Everyone else's desires; probably do not become.
A larger than mozilla firefox hot key program is not desirable.</p>

<p>Before contemplating an XLaunch fork;
the library interface should be learned.
By linking with the XLaunch library;
by new software projects;
XLaunch provided frequently convenient functions
and variable structures can be used.
In that fashion XLaunch is extensible.</p>

<p>XLaunch compatible programs should: be tiny; accomplish a specific task; and exit.
Constant consumption of half a gigabyte of RAM or more is obscenely wasteful.
For most window manager and desktop environment software;
constant wasteful RAM consumption is the succinct description
In the niche of fast lean code; XLaunch exists.</p>

<p>By a few curious software developers
the used graphics toolkit library would be desired.
Is gnome's GTK used?
Is kde's QT used?
The answer is no.
The X11 library, probably already required by most X11 client software, is used.
And a few other xorg provided libraries are used.</p>

<p>The mesa library, nvidia provided pre-compiled libraries and
fancy screen saver hacks are not provided and are not required.
If desired then by each video when viewed at youtube
by the video description the software used and home pages are cited.</p>

<p>If proper credit was accidentally omitted
then with a mere notification the mistake will be fixed.
To fellow artists who freely share their artwork; paramount admiration and respect is accorded.
To no talent, no vision, code forkers and to "fair use" abusers; significant disdain is accorded.</p>

<p>If the code is not yet uploaded
then the license and some insignificant details are being honed.
Before 2017 the source code will be uploaded.
More hugs; less bugs.</p>
