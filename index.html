        <p>A desktop environment is not provided.<br>
A window manager is not provided.<br>
For window manager fluff<br>
the required code megabytes are not provided.</p>

<p>By XLaunch an X11 hot key program launcher is provided.<br>
For window geometry modification code a few kilobytes are provided.<br>
Some rare tricks also are provided.</p>

<p>XLaunch is free software.<br>
Within the freedom XLaunch must remain.<br>
To the paydom XLaunch must never be exported.</p>

<p>To use or not to use; is that the question?<br>
For source tarball download; less than a megabyte is required.<br>
By watching the 90 second demonstration videos<br>
many hundred megabytes can be consumed.</p>

<p>Xlaunch requirements are minimal.<br>
Naturally, a POSIX is required.<br>
A Linux API translation wrapper probably does not suffice.</p>

<p>Software project xorg is required.<br>
A C compiler program, a make program, and a linker also are required.</p>

<p>Software projects linux-pam is optional.<br>
If linux-pam is not installed<br>
then program xl-lock only can not be compiled.<br>
By xl-lock user account pass phrase authentication is performed.
Therefore, a UID 0 owned SUID bit set xl-lock executable file is installed. </p>

<p>In the README file the required software,<br>
their universal resource locators,<br>
and command lines are provided.</p>

<p>For configuration file editing; any text editor will suffice.</p>

<p>For allocating time to investigate this project; thanks.<br>
Software developer information follows.</p>

<p>At release; for a few years already; XLaunch has been in use.<br>
The code quality is mature and revised.</p>

<p>A larger than mozilla program is not desired and was not created.<br>
To compile and link; less than a minute is required.</p>

<p>Before contemplating forking;<br>
the library interface should be inspected.<br>
By linking with the XLaunch library;<br>
by new software projects;<br>
XLaunch provided shared library functions<br>
and variable structures can be used.<br>
In that fashion XLaunch is extensible.  </p>

<p>To the XLaunch software suite<br>
for an additional program to be added<br>
a fork is not required.<br>
If the project is published separately;<br>
if code from XLaunch is not copied<br>
then any license can be applied.<br>
By a fork license departure is not possible.<br>
For license liberty<br>
in a separate software project;<br>
entirely original code is required.</p>

<p>An extension example follows.<br>
By the provided window modification code<br>
an optimal experience might not become.<br>
Larger than root windows can be created.<br>
From the root window visible area any window portion can depart.  </p>

<p>During window modification an anchor point change might be required.<br>
However, with an immobile cursor if coded<br>
then an anchor point change would not be required.<br>
A different experience would become.</p>

<p>Several window modification methods were tried.<br>
Most were abandoned.<br>
Ultimately, the software author's preference is provided.<br>
However, more than one good window size/slide method exists.<br>
Due to the XLaunch design in lieu of any method<br>
by the same key combination or by a different key combination<br>
an entirely different program can be launched.</p>

<p>Neither the GTK+ nor the QT libraries are used.<br>
The X11 library is used.<br>
A few other xorg provided libraries are used.<br>
Consequently, memory usage is light.</p>

<p>The mesa library and graphic hacks are not provided.<br>
At youtube in the video description;<br>
the software project names and home pages are cited.<br>
The default configuration file and<br>
the during video recording configuration file are similar.<br>
Therefore, by anyone the same tricks can be accomplished.</p>

<p>If credit was omitted then with notification the mistake will be fixed.<br>
To fellow free artists; paramount admiration  is accorded.<br>
To "fair use" abusers; and to forkers; disdain is accorded.</p>

<p>On 20161101 the source code was uploaded.
A fitness and usability warranty is not provided.</p>

<p>Because Xlaunch is no longer under development
when a decade old current release becomes
adequate compilation and use experience is expected.</p>

<p>2021 arrived and I am still using xlaunch.
But something to be said remains.
In 2016 I was very ill, barely able to walk,
unable to concentrate,
unable to remember, and severely chronic pained.
In a week about Xlib documentation was read xlaunch was created.
And maybe for two weeks was polished, hard to recollect.
From xlaunch do not expect much.  I like it.
It could have been much better if I was well.
</p>

<p>In 2021 some more projects were completed, or rather
further duration for development was not attained.
But since my well improved the quality also improved.
My artwork please enjoy.
