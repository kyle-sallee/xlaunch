By the following command an  overview  is  provided.	man man/xl.1
By the following command the license   is  displayed.	man man/xl.7
By the following command the software  is  installed.	make install
The    following environment variables are recognized:
CC; CFLAGS; DESTDIR; LDFLAGS; SUFFIX.

A make program; a C compiler; and a linker are required.
For linking the following libraries        are required:
X11; Xext; Xxf86vm; pam.

A Linux file system hierarchy compliant installation     is      provided.
Directory suffix names, such as the 64 in /usr/lib64/,   are not guessed.
To the following directories the SUFFIX variable content is      appended:
/usr/bin; /usr/include; /usr/lib.

The  following files are installed:
one  configuration;
few  header;
many manual page;
few  bash script;
one  shared linked library;
one  shared linked executable mode 04755 named xl-lock;
many shared linked executable.

If   mode SUID xl-lock is unreasonable
then both the  xl-lock executable file
and       the  xl-lock manual page should   be removed.
By a mode 0755 xl-lock for unlocking
when invoked by EUID 0 only passwords   can be verified.

Provided that required shared libraries can be discovered
then any non  standard installation,
such as in /opt/ or in a /home/ directory,  is possible.

When Xlaunch runs
if   configuration file ~/.config/xl is not available
then configuration file      /etc/xl is     read.
